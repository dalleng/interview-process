# Technical interview
*Internal or External - Max 1 hour*

Usually a simple challenge to measure the candidate coding skills. No restrictions should be made in terms of programming language choice.

## Internal

When by a software engineer of the company (on site or remote) it is recommended to use a collaborative platform so that you can save the result and review it before the on-site interview:

When choosing to do the interview using an existing online test platform it makes it easier to manage many candidates:
