*Optional - homework - ~4 hours*

This step is optional but is interesting to do it when you want to measure the code quality of a candidate because
the person will have time and will use their favorite dev environment.

* Use git to tracker progress
* Be flexible with the time frame 
* Host demo of the result (Heroku)
* Write quick set-up instructions on a readme
